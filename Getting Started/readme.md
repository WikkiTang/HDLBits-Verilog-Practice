# step one
Getting started in digital logic design can be overwhelming at first because you need to learn new concepts, a new **H**ardware **D**escription **L**anguage (e.g., Verilog), several new software packages, and often an FPGA board, all at the same time. HDLBits provides a way to practice designing and debugging simple circuits with a single click of "Simulate".

Designing a circuit requires several steps: Writing HDL (Verilog) code, compiling the code to produce a circuit, then simulating the circuit and fixing bugs.
