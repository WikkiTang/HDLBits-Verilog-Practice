# Wire
Create a module with one input and one output that behaves like a wire.

Unlike physical wires, wires (and other signals) in Verilog are directional. This means information flows in only one direction, from (usually one) source to the sinks (The source is also often called a driver that drives a value onto a wire). In a Verilog "continuous assignment" (assign left_side = right_side;), the value of the signal on the right side is driven onto the wire on the left side. The assignment is "continuous" because the assignment continues all the time even if the right side's value changes. A continuous assignment is not a one-time event.

The ports on a module also have a direction (usually input or output). An input port is driven by something from outside the module, while an output port drives something outside. When viewed from inside the module, an input port is a driver or source, while an output port is a sink.

The diagram below illustrates how each part of the circuit corresponds to each bit of Verilog code. The module and port declarations create the black portions of the circuit. Your task is to create a wire (in green) by adding an assign statement to connect in to out. The parts outside the box are not your concern, but you should know that your circuit is tested by connecting signals from our test harness to the ports on your top_module.

# Wire4
Create a module with 3 inputs and 4 outputs that behaves like wires that makes these connections:

a -> w
b -> x
b -> y
c -> z
The diagram below illustrates how each part of the circuit corresponds to each bit of Verilog code. From outside the module, there are three input ports and four output ports.

When you have multiple assign statements, the order in which they appear in the code does not matter. Unlike a programming language, assign statements ("continuous assignments") describe connections between things, not the action of copying a value from one thing to another.

One potential source of confusion that should perhaps be clarified now: The green arrows here represent connections between wires, but are not wires in themselves. The module itself already has 7 wires declared (named a, b, c, w, x, y, and z). This is because input and output declarations actually declare a wire unless otherwise specified. Writing input wire a is the same as input a. Thus, the assign statements are not creating wires, they are creating the connections between the 7 wires that already exist.

# Notgate
Create a module that implements a NOT gate.

This circuit is similar to wire, but with a slight difference. When making the connection from the wire in to the wire out we're going to implement an inverter (or "NOT-gate") instead of a plain wire.

Use an assign statement. The assign statement will continuously drive the inverse of in onto wire out.

# Andgate
Create a module that implements an AND gate.

This circuit now has three wires (a, b, and out). Wires a and b already have values driven onto them by the input ports. But wire out currently is not driven by anything. Write an assign statement that drives out with the AND of signals a and b.

Note that this circuit is very similar to the NOT gate, just with one more input. If it sounds different, it's because I've started describing signals as being driven (has a known value determined by something attached to it) or not driven by something. Input wires are driven by something outside the module. assign statements will drive a logic level onto a wire. As you might expect, a wire cannot have more than one driver (what is its logic level if there is?), and a wire that has no drivers will have an undefined value (often treated as 0 when synthesizing hardware).

#Norgate
Create a module that implements a NOR gate. A NOR gate is an OR gate with its output inverted. A NOR function needs two operators when written in Verilog.

An assign statement drives a wire (or "net", as it's more formally called) with a value. This value can be as complex a function as you want, as long as it's a combinational (i.e., memory-less, with no hidden state) function. An assign statement is a continuous assignment because the output is "recomputed" whenever any of its inputs change, forever, much like a simple logic gate.

# Xnorgate
Create a module that implements an XNOR gate.

# Wire decl
The circuits so far have been simple enough that the outputs are simple functions of the inputs. As circuits become more complex, you will need wires to connect internal components together. When you need to use a wire, you should declare it in the body of the module, somewhere before it is first used. (In the future, you will encounter more types of signals and variables that are also declared the same way, but for now, we'll start with a signal of type wire).

# 7458
Create a module with the same functionality as the 7458 chip. It has 10 inputs and 2 outputs. You may choose to use an assign statement to drive each of the output wires, or you may choose to declare (four) wires for use as intermediate signals, where each internal wire is driven by the output of one of the AND gates. For extra practice, try it both ways.
