# HDLBits-Verilog-Practice
Trying to put my codes for HDLBits on Github. This is also a good way for reviewing those problems.

HDLBits(https://hdlbits.01xz.net) is a good website for learning and reviewing Verilog.

(Not sure if these problems are too easy for an interview...but at least I do practiced my Verilog programming skill :ï¼‰)
