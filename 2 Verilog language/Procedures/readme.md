# Alwaysblock1
For synthesizing hardware, two types of always blocks are relevant:

Combinational: always @(*)

Clocked: always @(posedge clk)

Combinational always blocks are equivalent to assign statements, thus there is always a way to express a combinational circuit both ways. The choice between which to use is mainly an issue of which syntax is more convenient. The syntax for code inside a procedural block is different from code that is outside. Procedural blocks have a richer set of statements (e.g., if-then, case), cannot contain continuous assignments*, but also introduces many new non-intuitive ways of making errors. (*Procedural continuous assignments do exist, but are somewhat different from continuous assignments, and are not synthesizable.)

For combinational always blocks, always use a sensitivity list of (*). Explicitly listing out the signals is error-prone (if you miss one), and is ignored for hardware synthesis. If you explicitly specify the sensitivity list and miss a signal, the synthesized hardware will still behave as though (*) was specified, but the simulation will not and not match the hardware's behaviour. (In SystemVerilog, use always_comb.)

A note on wire vs. reg: The left-hand-side of an assign statement must be a net type (e.g., wire), while the left-hand-side of a procedural assignment (in an always block) must be a variable type (e.g., reg). These types (wire vs. reg) have nothing to do with what hardware is synthesized, and is just syntax left over from Verilog's use as a hardware simulation language.

# alwaysblock2

For hardware synthesis, there are two types of always blocks that are relevant:

Combinational: always @(*)

Clocked: always @(posedge clk)

Clocked always blocks create a blob of combinational logic just like combinational always blocks, but also creates a set of flip-flops (or "registers") at the output of the blob of combinational logic. Instead of the outputs of the blob of logic being visible immediately, the outputs are visible only immediately after the next (posedge clk).

Blocking vs. Non-Blocking Assignment

There are three types of assignments in Verilog:

Continuous assignments (assign x = y;). Can only be used when not inside a procedure ("always block").

Procedural blocking assignment: (x = y;). Can only be used inside a procedure.

Procedural non-blocking assignment: (x <= y;). Can only be used inside a procedure.

In a combinational always block, use blocking assignments. In a clocked always block, use non-blocking assignments. A full understanding of why is not particularly useful for hardware design and requires a good understanding of how Verilog simulators keep track of events. Not following this rule results in extremely hard to find errors that are both non-deterministic and differ between simulation and synthesized hardware.
